      <div id="ide-selector">
          Select the Visual Studio environment you want to work with:&nbsp;<a href="#" data-name="xs">macOS</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="#" data-name="vs">Windows</a>
      </div>

      <h2>Duration</h2>
      <p>10 minutes</p>

      <ide name="vs">
      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
          Visual Studio 2017 requires a few F# components be installed to work with and create the F# projects used in these exercises. These components can be added by running the <b>Visual Studio Installer</b> found in the Windows Start menu.
      </p>
      <p>
          If you have installed the <b>.NET desktop development</b> workload, you will already have the <b>F# language support</b> component. To create new F# projects using .NET Core, you will also need the <b>.NET Core cross-platform development</b> workload. To create new F# projects using the .NET Framework instead, you will need the <b>F# desktop language support</b> component as well.
      </p>
      </ide>

      <h2>Lab goals</h2>
      <p>
        The primary goal of this lab is to gain a deeper understanding of how to organize code files in F#.
        The high level goals of this activity are as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Open the <b>FSharpToDo</b> Android application located in the <b>Exercise 1</b> -> <b>Start</b> folder.
          Attempt to run the application and inspect the errors; these are a result of the files being misordered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reorder the files <strong>one at a time</strong> and compile the application after each move.
          You will notice that when files are misordered there will be a cascade effect on the errors.
          This is due to the dependencies the files have on one another. It is important to move a file, run the application, and repeat.
        </li>
        <li>
          You've completed the exercise when the app successfully compiles.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p><img src="res/images/fileorder.png" /></p>

      <h2>Required assets</h2>
      <p>
        There are two F# projects in the <strong>Lab 01 Resources</strong> folder, one is the starting solution you will work to reorder,
        and the second is a completed version of the program you can refer to at the end of the exercise to check your work.
        Please make sure you have this folder before you begin.
      </p>

        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <h2>Reorder the files in the FSharpToDo app</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to make this app run successfully on an Android simulator or device</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Locate the starter project contained in the <b>Lab 01 Resources/Start</b> folder included with this exercise and open the <strong>FSharpTodo.sln</strong> file using Visual Studio.</li>
          <li>Run the app

          <ul>
            <li>Make sure Visual Studio is set to &quot;Debug&quot; and open on an Android Player or a connected device.</li>
            <li>After compiling the project click inspect the <b>Errors</b> window to view the build errors.<img src="res/images/errors.png" alt="Errors window showing several build errors resulting from file order issues in our F# project."/></li>
          </ul>

          <li>You will note a number of errors, look for errors, which state things like &quot;The type... is not defined&quot;, that will help clue you into which files need to be moved.
            <ide name="xs">
              To move a file you can click and drag it.
            </ide>
            <ide name="vs">
              To move a file, select it and use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Down arrow</kbd>.
            </ide>
            <br><img src="res/images/fstodosln.png" alt="Solution pad of the FSharpToDo application."/>
          </li>

          <li>Repeat step 3 until the app compiles and runs correctly.
          </li>
        </ol>

            <p>You will know you have completed the activity when the app runs in an emulator or on a device.
            If you are unable to make it run please refer to the <b>Lab 01 Resources/Complete</b> folder to see the solution.</p>

            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>During this lab you have worked to gain a deeper understanding of file organization in F#. We reordered the files in an F# project to make an Android project compile successfully.</p>
